CS280 Programming Assignment 0 
Fall 2017 
Due Sept 20 by class time, absolute late deadline by Sept 25 before class

This assignment is designed to help get you used to the Vocareum system. It will be graded but 
will be assigned a very small percentage of the overall grade; it is mostly intended to get you 
going on using Vocareum. 

Write a C++ program that loops through all of the command line arguments that are passed to 
the program. For each argument, you are to test to see if there is a file with that name. [you test 
by attempting to open the file and checking to see if the open was successful]. Your program 
should do the following 

i.
If there is NOT a file with the name given in the argument, print, on a single line, the 
name of the file, a space, and the string FILE NOT FOUND

ii.
If there is a file with the name given in the argument, print, on a single line, the name of 
the file, a space, and an integer representing the number of characters in the file.


You will note that there should be one line of output for each command line argument that is 
specified.
